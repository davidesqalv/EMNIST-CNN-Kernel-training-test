# EMNIST-CNN-Kernel-training-test
Training a CNN with the EMNIST Balanced dataset with different kernel matrix sizes and evaluating accuracy

The model layers are printed after training, to get a better look on the inner workings of a Convolutional Neural Network

Kernel sizes tested:
- 8
- 16
- 24
- 64 + 128

Also a simple dense layer instead of the convolutional layer was tested, which resulted in overfitting

Same test was done for a few Chinese characters, just to assess how it would work with something different than a letter
